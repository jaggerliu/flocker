Record types for representing deployment models.

There are different categories of classes:

1. Those that involve information that can be both in configuration and state.
   This includes ``Deployment`` and all classes on it.
   (Metadata should really be configuration only, but that hasn't been
   fixed yet on the model level.)
2. State-specific classes, currently ``NodeState``.
3. Configuration-specific classes, none implemented yet.
